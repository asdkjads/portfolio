                <p> My name is Lilian Zhao and I am currently a Dublin High School student. I aspire to work in the field of geology, and I plan on reaching this goal by taking science courses in high school and majoring in geology in college. This is my career choice because it is something I&rsquo;m interested in and because of that, I would be able to do it well.</p> 
                <p>In 8th grade, we had to work on a &quot;Civics Actions Project&quot;. It was a project that took about 5 months and we had to identify a problem, research, and find a way to solve it. We had to think analytically, stay organized, and work well in a team. These are skills that would be useful in working in geology. At first I didn&rsquo;t want to do the project, but I actually ended up enjoying it and it helped me learn how to better the community and to take action to solve problems.</p> 
                <p>This year, I am in the Technovation Club at DHS, where you create an app to help solve a problem. I am looking forward to it because it&rsquo;s similar to the CAP project.</p> 
                <p>Thank you for your time. </p>
