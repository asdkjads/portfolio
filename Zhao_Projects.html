                    <p class="p">For this partner-based project, we created a game where the player can make decisions for the character, the goal being to direct the character to school. In each setting, the player has options for what to do, such as choosing which bus to take. Then, one bus could take the character to school, while the other takes the character someplace else. For this project, we learned how to use &quot;broadcast&quot; so that the game would respond to the player&rsquo;s decisions. In the game, we also included some settings where the player had to use the arrow keys to navigate to the next location while avoiding obstacles. This was challenging because it was buggy at first, and my partner and I had to experiment with different code to find a way to make it run smoothly.</p>

                    <p class="p">For this partner-based project, we manipulated images with Python. The goal was to create a border and to incorporate geometric abstraction. We prepared for this project with assignments that involved image manipulation, and we were warned that this project would be challenging, which it was. The teacher refused to help us, but would give us advice to lead us in right direction. However, I learned a lot from this project. The little guidance we were giving as we were coding the project helped me grow as a learner, and I look forward to doing similar projects in the future.</p>
